Welcome to my little repository of stuff I made for the Casio Algebra FX 2.0 Plus. I've had this calculator for about 4 years now and never stopped writing programs for it (because it's just more convenient than remembering every formula). In this repo I want to upload all the stuff that might be useful for other people.

If you encounter any bugs or other problems feel free to submit an issue to the repo or fork, fix and create a pull request. Thanks in advance!

I will add stuff over time so if there's nothing interesting for you yet, keep an eye on it anyway because the repo will grow over time.

**Note**: I'm only going to add stuff *I* made. Programs made by other people won't be uploaded here (unless someone messages me to add their program).

**Another note**: most of this will be in German. I will create folders for each program and attach some tag for the language though.
